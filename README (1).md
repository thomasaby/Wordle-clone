# Wordle Clone

A simple clone of the popular game **Wordle**, built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. Try to guess the hidden word in 6 attempts, with color-coded feedback after each guess to help you find the correct word.

## Features

- **Word guessing**: Guess a 5-letter word in 6 attempts.
- **Feedback system**: Color-coded feedback (green, yellow, gray) based on whether the letter is in the correct position, in the word but in the wrong position, or not in the word.
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play

1. Enter a 5-letter word in the input box.
2. Press the **Enter** key to submit your guess.
3. After each guess, feedback will be shown in the form of color-coded tiles:
   - **Green**: Letter is in the correct position.
   - **Yellow**: Letter is in the word but not in the correct position.
   - **Gray**: Letter is not in the word.
4. You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word.
5. After guessing correctly or using all attempts, the game will show you whether you've won or lost.
